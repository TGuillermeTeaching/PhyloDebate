1 - What is a phylogeny for (beyond cladistics)?
  
  * Macroevolution (patterns and process)
  * Public health (Ebola study)
  * Conservation

  > In the end, phylogenies are the tools we need to study things in the context of evolution (Dhobsansky quote)

2 - The big picture

Phylogenetics = solving relation among traits assuming descendants with modification


Using traits to solve relations among stuff (dead or alive) assuming descendant with modification through time.


traits
solving relations among stuff
assuming descendant with modification
through time


Traits are:
  
  * DNA
  * Proteins
  * Morphology
  * Behavior
  * Biogeography
  * All of them

Solving relations can be done by applying an optimality criterion (e.g. things are always bifurcating and imply the minimum number of changes)
 
 * Max likelihood
 * Parsimony

But things can also be near-optimal (we assume error and prior beliefs in our methods)

 * Bayesian

We need to keep in mind what do we need the tree for!


Quick dating intro (rates = time / length)


3 - The tricky things

  * Parsimony or ML/Bayesian? Do we use models or processes?
    >AT: Bayesian: incorporation of prior information and other things

  * Do we use models or distances for building trees?

* What are our assumptions about evolution (coalescent, Yule or BD? -> FBD!)
    > AT: Tree models - coalescent vs Yule vs BD and others - an example of a big effect on tree estimation [tie into discussion on effect of speciation/extinction]

  * What models do we use? Over/under parametrisation?
    >AT: Limitations: complex models can run for a long time + Single gene vs concatenation vs species tree

  * We build the whole process or step by step (e.g. topology, then living, then fossils)
    >AT: Simultaneous estimate of tree, time, trait evolution etc

  * How do we solve the circularity of the rates = time / length equation?
    > Time trees: rates vs node calibrations, models


  * How confident can we be about ACE? What can we do when we ignore all the past?
